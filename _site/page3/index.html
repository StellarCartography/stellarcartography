        Flux calibration in TESS
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2016</span>

    <p>TESS will take (and save) Full Frame Images at 30 minute cadence for their entire mission. However, like Kepler (and K2), the TESS pipeline will provide a differential photometry data product. i.e. the data is <em>not</em> flux calibrated.</p>

<p>The Guest-Investigator (GI) program for TESS does provide a level of funding for software projects if they are doing something value-added and unique for the community. Flux calibration should be very doable, given the FFI’s.</p>

<p>The question I see (and without enough knowledge of the TESS detector and hardware) is this:
<strong>What are the calibration frames that are required to do this?</strong>. Put another way, what <em>could</em> Kepler have done to accomplish this?</p>

        How would a giant planet affect binary star evolution?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>There’s a problem with making short period (like, 0.2 day) M dwarf binaries. They take too long to form starting from relatively close binaries (e.g. 2 day), like…  a Hubble time to lose angular momentum. Yet, we see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6056">many systems</a> like this.</p>

<p>Most people seem to care right now about how binary stars will affect planet evolution (e.g. ejecting planets from systems).</p>

<p>3rd body interactions have always been a popular culprit for forming such tight binaries. Galactic tidal influence might be able to do it too… but that’s usually thought about for <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3145">wide binaries</a></p>

<p>So the idea:
Get best “Nbody model” (see my ignorance in its raw form!) of binary star system, with moderate separations (like, 1-10 days). Add a giant planet around 1 star. Run lots of simulations for 1 Gyr</p>

    <p>Can we observe dust moving? In other words, can we see the proper motions of the ISM? It <em>should</em> be moving around relative to us. There is some known about the shell of ISM around the Sun, but mystery remains about the small-scale structure of the ISM throughout the Milky Way.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways to approach this problem:</p>

<h3 id="1-direct-observation">1. Direct observation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>requires high-res molecular (radio/mm) maps over time, or high-res IR emission maps</li>
  <li>most current maps available in literature probably not sufficient over large ares, and certainly not stable over time.</li>
  <li>most IR surveys do not have the required resolution, but future missions would</li>
  <li>radio/mm probably has the resolution and stability needed to directly track the motions of the near-field ISM</li>
  <li>gives some info about density structure, but lots of info about kinematics and dynamical structure of the ISM</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-variations-of-extinction-eb-v">2. Variations of extinction, E(B-V)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>probably easier to detect in the blue optical, can possibly be done from large surveys determining the extinction of distant stars shining through near-field ISM that is moving</li>
  <li>gives less specific detail on the motions of the ISM relative to the Sun</li>
  <li>does give info on the density structure of the ISM on potentially very small scales</li>
  <li>people have started to compare dust extinction maps, e.g. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2495">Planck vs WISE</a> which may be a way forward</li>

        Hack Day Idea - Kepler FFI's

    <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>These images have been largely ignored, though the opinion of the community has been that if the right question were posed they would be a gold mine.</p>

<p>I don’t have the perfect question, but I have a few mediocre ones:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can we find transients in the Kepler FFI’s?</li>
  <li>Can we find new eclipsing binaries or pulsators (use supersmoother, like w/ S82 work) using the FFI’s?</li>
  <li>Can we find stars with long term variability (e.g. LPVs, YSOs) using the FFI’s?</li>
</ol>

<p>Images are <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/ffi/">here</a></p>

<p>These transients could be from Novae/SuperNovae, or flares, or asteroids (less likely given 30min cadence)</p>

<p>A first-pass was done as an REU project <a href="http://physics.nd.edu/assets/45942/vande_kolk_bryant.pdf">years ago</a></p>

<p>And <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0297">this is</a> the only real result in the literature using FFI’s I’m aware of:</p>

<p>There are 53 of these images, w/ 30min exposures each, and an area of ~100 sq deg. While this pales in comparison to the data from the Kepler targeted objects, it is actually not a shabby time series catalog. Stripe 82 had an area of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7382">~300 sq deg</a> and 70-90 exposures…</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Ben Montet is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160801316M">on it!</a></p>

        How many eclipsing binaries in an open cluster?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>This is a simple question I’ve been interested in for a long time: Given excellent statistics about the stars we see in an open cluster, how many eclipsing binaries should we observe in a given dataset (e.g. Kepler)?</p>

<p>Given excellent observations of a cluster, we can constrain the properties of binaries.
The parameters to fit would be the total binary fraction and the mass ratio distribution (maybe could be described using a slope or something).</p>

<p>An older cluster’s dynamical/tidal history through the Galaxy should affect it’s binary population. This might be an interesting way to constrain that history versus field stars. Or versus young clusters.</p>

<p>Other Cluster / EB ideas:
It would be nice to have a definitive “Catalog of Variable Stars in M67” based on every available time domain dataset.</p>

<ul>
  <li>K2</li>
  <li>2MASS Cal-PSWDB</li>
  <li>LINEAR</li>
  <li>Catalina</li>
  <li>several one-off datasets</li>
</ul>

<p>Seems like a great hack-day idea too, doing really crappy forward or Monte Carlo model of what you should see, taking in best guesses for everything</p>
