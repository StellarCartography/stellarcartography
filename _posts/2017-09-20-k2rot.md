title: Stellar Rotation in K2
---


## Intro

*this post is in-prep*

Kepler measured lots of rotation periods. Differential rotation was... harder. Or maybe impossible in many cases.


## In walks Gaia

wrote [short paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161008563D) last year on rotation Kepler, using Gaia to filter our subgiants, find period bimodality extends from M dwarfs all the way to G dwarfs.

time to extend this to K2, search stars of more ages/masses. have NASA-ADAP grant to study this with Ruth, need students!

## Fun Avenues

this project isn't just about the nuts & bolts of measuring rotation, though that is a neat project in of itself.

- calibrate gyrochronology
- define 3d structure/extent of the period bimodality
- star formation history, how localized/coherent it can be. Compare to SFH in M31 from HST!
- look for influence of spiral arm passage?
- look for substructure in the 5-D space of (X,Y,Z, Color, Period)
- rotation versus OTHER THINGS, like metallicity, planet(s), age...
- rotation *off* the main sequence (e.g. Subgiant evolution, binaries, blue stragglers?)
