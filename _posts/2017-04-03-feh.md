title: Photometric Metallicities
---

Here is a cool figure that I made with [S. J. Schmidt](http://www.sarahjaneschmidt.com) a few years ago at a research [retreat in beautiful Friday Harbor](https://www.instagram.com/p/xvLZM1lCMc/), based on work she was doing with [APOGEE](http://www.sdss3.org/surveys/apogee.php) + [WISE](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/main/index.html) data for low-mass stars (see very relevant paper [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.460.2611S))

We added to her APOGEE work by including dwarf stars processed by the SDSS Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP).

What comes out of this figure is a potentially useful result: you can measure the metallicity of a star (roughly) using it's WISE (W1-W2) color!

For M dwarfs, the [Fe/H] values can be determined by subtracting the measured (W1-W2) color from the [stellar locus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1875) value for a given (r-z) color. This is a fairly small amplitude signal, however, with the offset in (W1-W2) having a max of +/-0.1 mag. The effect is less pronounced for earlier type stars (GK) measured by SDSS, but is still in the same direction about the locus.

## Next Steps
- What is the cause of this signal?
    - molecular features that show up for cool stars and are metallicity dependent I guess
- If we update the sample w/ latest public data from SDSS (BOSS) and APOGEE, is the signal still there?
- Can we find more [cool dwarfs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0014) in APOGEE? (>M4)
    - (W1-W2) appears to broaden through M dwarfs. Does it continue?
- Is the signal at all measurable for earlier type (GK) stars?
- Fit a 3D polynomial to parameterize
- Redo as function of (J-W1) instead of (r-z)
    - then doesn't depend on SDSS photometry, can be done for *all WISE stars*!
- [Fe/H] map of nearby Milky Way?
    - use Gaia to pick only dwarfs

**What I need:** People who know more about the current state of the field for "chemical cartography" of our Milky Way. Is it still exciting to measure [Fe/H] gradients? Look for kinematic+chemical substructure?
