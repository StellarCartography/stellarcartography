## What are Scallops?

The late John Stauffer first showed me these stars from K2

what are they?!
Zahn have a nice model of a spotted star + a dark/opaque disk. I quite like this model.



## A weird flare

There's this big flare, and it stays bright... wtf?!

what if we modeled the light curve empirically w/ a GP, then fit the flare? Can we show the flare is rotating in/out of view? Is the excess brightness later due to the long tail of the flare?

## Can we build a simple model?
we need a starspot model + a disk

now there's 4 TESS Sectors worth of 2-min data, with several interesting flares. Get it all! Phase fold vs time
