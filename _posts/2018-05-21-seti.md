title: SETI with ZTF
---


## Intro

[These slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jradavenport/seti-with-ztf-and-lsst) given (remotely) to the [VASCO](https://vasconsite.wordpress.com) workshop in early 2018

The Point (TM): ZTF (or LSST) isn't necessarily the ideal place to do SETI work, but we get it for "free". Might as well be looking!
It could be a critical piece of the ZTF/LSST - Astrobiology connection.

## ZTF is Online
data streams are rolling now, we should put in alert trigger thingys.

lightcurves will come. do batch analysis later

## Search Methods

Here are some actual approaches I have come up with that we might pursue, roughly in order of ease of implementation. This list should be viewed as perpetually in-prep.

1) alerts from the stars within the "restricted Earth Transit Zone ([Heller & Pudritz 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AsBio..16..259H))
 - anytime we can see them w/ ZTF
 - especially at our opposition (i.e. when *we* appear to transit)

2) alerts from known exoplanet host systems
 - use an existing archive of exoplanets, like [this](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu) or [this](http://exoplanets.org)

3) alerts coinciding with any known transit conjunction (mid-transit)
 - allow some tolerance window to account for TTVs

4) VASCO-type events, stars appearing or disappearing.
 - Esp. stars appearing that do not have a Gaia DR2 detection, for example.
 - stars disappearing will be very interesting

5) event (alert?) coordination/synchronization (e.g. see [Makovetskii 1977](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977SvA....21..251M), [Shostak 2004](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004IAUS..213..409S))
 - especially the SETI ellipsoid, a'la SN1987A ([Lemarchand 1994](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994Ap%26SS.214..209L))
 - could use galactic novae to provide time/place
 - list of [new Novae](https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Koji.Mukai/novae/novae.html)
 - [historic Novae](http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/nova_list.html) (till 2010)
