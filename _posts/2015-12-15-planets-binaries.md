title: How would a giant planet affect binary star evolution?
---

There's a problem with making short period (like, 0.2 day) M dwarf binaries. They take too long to form starting from relatively close binaries (e.g. 2 day), like...  a Hubble time to lose angular momentum. Yet, we see [many systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6056) like this.

Most people seem to care right now about how binary stars will affect planet evolution (e.g. ejecting planets from systems).

3rd body interactions have always been a popular culprit for forming such tight binaries. Galactic tidal influence might be able to do it too... but that's usually thought about for [wide binaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3145)

So the idea:
Get best "Nbody model" (see my ignorance in its raw form!) of binary star system, with moderate separations (like, 1-10 days). Add a giant planet around 1 star. Run lots of simulations for 1 Gyr
