title: How many halo stars are in Kepler?
---

There should be a small number of stars in the Kepler (and K2) data that belong to the halo, just based on their dynamics.

It might be interesting to find them!

These would have systematically older ages, and would be useful for stretching our gyrochronology methods.

It looks like Sebastian Lepine has already written a K2 proposal on this.
