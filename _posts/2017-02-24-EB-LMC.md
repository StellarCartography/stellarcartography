title: Distribution of Eclipsing Binaries in the SMC and LMC
---

There are some *awesome* surveys of variability that are being under utilized. One such gem is OGLE, which now has a [catalog of over 48k](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06394) eclipsing binary star systems in the SMC and LMC!

With such a large sample, and near complete coverage of SMC/LMC (and in-between....) it would be amazing to see: **are there variations of the eclipsing binary star population over an entire galaxy?**

To do so, you might combine this variability survey with other spatial surveys that have traced the [star formation history](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1422) of the LMC/SMC... here's a more [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05347) on the subject.

We (or at least I) might naively expect that the orbital period distribution would be changed as a function of mean age of the stars in a spatial bin - in other words, dynamic processing would harden (shorten) the periods over time. Long period, detached systems would become more rare over time, and so also increasing the fraction of W UMa type systems.

[Here's](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10597) a catalog with some updated fits to the light curves for the OGLE-III LMC systems.

Finally, working in the temporal-spatial domain is good practice for the forthcoming "LSST era". As they say, publish early, publish often!
