title: Hack Day Idea - Kepler FFI's
---

These images have been largely ignored, though the opinion of the community has been that if the right question were posed they would be a gold mine.

I don't have the perfect question, but I have a few mediocre ones:

1. Can we find transients in the Kepler FFI's?
2. Can we find new eclipsing binaries or pulsators (use supersmoother, like w/ S82 work) using the FFI's?
3. Can we find stars with long term variability (e.g. LPVs, YSOs) using the FFI's?


Images are [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/kepler/ffi/)

These transients could be from Novae/SuperNovae, or flares, or asteroids (less likely given 30min cadence)

A first-pass was done as an REU project [years ago](http://physics.nd.edu/assets/45942/vande_kolk_bryant.pdf)


And [this is](http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0297) the only real result in the literature using FFI's I'm aware of:



There are 53 of these images, w/ 30min exposures each, and an area of ~100 sq deg. While this pales in comparison to the data from the Kepler targeted objects, it is actually not a shabby time series catalog. Stripe 82 had an area of [~300 sq deg](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7382) and 70-90 exposures...


**Update:** Ben Montet is [on it!](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160801316M)
