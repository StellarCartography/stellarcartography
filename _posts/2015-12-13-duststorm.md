Can we observe dust moving? In other words, can we see the proper motions of the ISM? It *should* be moving around relative to us. There is some known about the shell of ISM around the Sun, but mystery remains about the small-scale structure of the ISM throughout the Milky Way.


There are 2 ways to approach this problem:

### 1. Direct observation


- requires high-res molecular (radio/mm) maps over time, or high-res IR emission maps
- most current maps available in literature probably not sufficient over large ares, and certainly not stable over time.
- most IR surveys do not have the required resolution, but future missions would
- radio/mm probably has the resolution and stability needed to directly track the motions of the near-field ISM
- gives some info about density structure, but lots of info about kinematics and dynamical structure of the ISM


### 2. Variations of extinction, E(B-V)


- probably easier to detect in the blue optical, can possibly be done from large surveys determining the extinction of distant stars shining through near-field ISM that is moving
- gives less specific detail on the motions of the ISM relative to the Sun
- does give info on the density structure of the ISM on potentially very small scales
- people have started to compare dust extinction maps, e.g. [Planck vs WISE](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2495) which may be a way forward
